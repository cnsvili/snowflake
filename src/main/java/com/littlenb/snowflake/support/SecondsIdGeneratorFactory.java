 * The unique id has 64bits (long), default allocated as blow:<br>
 * <li>sign: The highest bit is 0
 * <li>delta seconds: The next 28 bits, represents delta seconds since a customer epoch(2017-01-01 00:00:00.000).
 *                    Supports about 8.7 years until to 2025-07-04 21:24:15.000
 * <li>worker id: The next 22 bits, represents the worker's id which assigns based on database, max id is about 420W
 * <li>sequence: The next 13 bits, represents a sequence within the same second, max for 8192/s<br><br>
